# Best Practices
Best practices for software development, put here for me to remember or share with others. These are my personal preferences and may not represent best practices for scenarios outside of my own experiences. 

## Work Atmosphere
- Have a dedicated physical space to do work
- Keep work space separate from spaces dedicated to other activites (such as eating, playing, sleeping, etc.)
- Block work time. Turn on "do not disturb" for devices.

## Coding
- Keep project-related settings in the project (instead of the IDE) so it is more transferrable
  - Use 'Dev Containers' when possible, with settings inside a `.devcontainer` folder
  - When using *Prettier*, keep settings in a `.prettierrc` file instead of in your IDE settings
- Save my settings with dotfiles
  - Easily transfers to other machines if needed
